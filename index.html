              <h2>My Journey.. </h2>
                <p style="color: rgb(248, 248, 248); font-size: 19px;">The question I always get asked is "why get into tech when you have a Sociology degree?" Here's why..</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Dosis', sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">I was introduced to tech when I
                was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life post-university. I attended a webinar about “getting into tech” and heard
                about the tons of different avenues that form the industry and I was completely sold as it opened my eyes even more to how much technology is shaping the world we live in and I knew I wanted to be a part of it. I had made up my mind that I would one day become a DevOps Engineer as it is a role that requires specialisation in many aspects which excites me, but I knew it was going to be challenging as
                I had ZERO experience. Working full-time, equipped with thousands of free online resources and a huge amount of resilience, I dedicated my free time to
                learning how to code in HTML and CSS, attended webinars about various coding languages and tried to build my knowledge so that I could eventually get into the industry. <br>I
                became more and more drawn to Cloud Computing and found the AWS re/Start programme in which i was offered a place on the course. It has been the steepest learning-curve I have experienced but in 12 weeks, I have learnt
                what it would take most people months/years to learn. I now have foundational knowledge in Linux bash scripting, IT Networking and Security,
                MySQL, Python and AWS.

I am confident in my ability to discuss services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 services, VPC's, Amazon CloudFront, Relational and Non-Relational Databases such as RDS and DynamoDB and more to a Cloud Practitioner level. I have hands on experience working with AWS services as I used AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, Amazon Cognito and Amazon API Gateway to deploy a ride sharing app named ‘Wild Rydes’, on AWS. In addition to this, I have completed various labs to familiarise myself with the services I have learnt and to gain a better understanding of how they work in conjunction with each other and what their capabilities are.

            <p class="card-text">I completed a workshop led by AWS Solutions Architects to create and launch a ride sharing web app named 'Wild Rydes', using AWS services. During the process, I used AWS CodeCommit to host the sites repository and the AWS Amplify Console to deploy the static website. I then used AWS Cognito to create a user pool in order to manage user accounts. AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB were then used to build a backend process for handling requests from my web application. I was then able to use an API Gateway to expose the Lambda function I built as a RESTful API in order to turn my statically hosted website into a dynamic web application. <br><br> <a href="">Click here</a> to view the project</p>

            <p class="card-text">Using Python programming, i created an Alien Invasion game whereby you are a ship, shooting down aliens and you aquire points each time you kill an alien. In order to complete this task, i had to use different python elements such as modules and classes. I also used refactoring in order to make the code less complex and much more readable. Within my code, i used while loops, if statements, functions and more. Creating this game solidified my understanding of Python programming and has motivated me to create more games using Python in order to gain more experience and build my confidence. <br><br><br> <a href="">Click here</a> to view the project</p>
